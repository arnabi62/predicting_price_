# predicting_price_
here there are some data on price of house based on square ft., now to calculate the price of any house by given square ft i have applied three methods 1.  I have calculated it from graph  2. calculated by considering the difference rate at which value is increasing 3. calculated by cnsidering median
next code is done by linear regression using sklearn on same data which obviously gives better result
